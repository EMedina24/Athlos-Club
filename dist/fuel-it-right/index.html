Lockdown guidelines have forced us to stay indoors, and the events we’ve been training for have been cancelled or postponed. But instead of becoming lazy, we can make the most of this time by maintaining our fitness, working on problem areas, and engaging in virtual training and racing with the IRONMAN Virtual Club.</p><p>But before you hop on your trainer for 4 hours, know that virtual races and intense or long indoor training sessions need a nutrition plan, just like in the real world. Here’s what you need to know when you move your training, racing, and nutrition indoors.</p><h3 id="hydration">Hydration</h3><p>There is no natural air cooling in indoor training, which means the body can't dissipate the heat it produces during exercise quite as well as it does outdoors. In short, this means you sweat a lot more. A powerful fan can undoubtedly help, but hydration is vital whenever you’re sweating. Here are some guidelines per your training duration:</p><p><strong><strong>40 minutes or less:</strong></strong> Just water is enough, but take a potassium-magnesium sachet afterwards.</p><p><strong><strong>1 hour +: </strong></strong>Use a sports drink mixture containing carbohydrates and electrolytes in your bottle, or take one Enervit Salt Caps dissolved in water every hour.</p><h3 id="supplements">Supplements</h3><p>Carbohydrates are essential for the triathlete in training. They can stimulate your training, reduce muscle fatigue, and speed up recovery times between sessions. Not taking in enough carbohydrates in sessions longer than an hour would be a lost opportunity and also render your training less effective. Here are some guidelines per training duration:</p><p><strong><strong>1-2 hours:</strong></strong> Take 30g of carbohydrates per hour from a gel or Enervit One Hand.</p><p><strong><strong>2+ hours:</strong></strong> Take 60g of carbohydrates per hour from a gel, sports drink, or energy bars.</p><h3 id="recuperate">Recuperate</h3><p>Remember: recovery trains. The nutrients you consume in the first half-hour after your session can reduce fatigue and speed up recovery between sessions. You will need water, minerals, carbohydrates and essential amino acids. Recovery drinks are ideal: in one gulp you can get everything your body is craving.</p><p>To get the maximum benefit from your indoor sessions, you should eat a meal containing protein afterwards: fish, chicken, turkey, eggs, and tofu are all good options. These foods will help activate the proper muscle processes. (If you’re having trouble finding these foods then a good alternative is to add protein powder to your recovery drink.)</p><h3 id="stay-positive-stay-strong">Stay positive, stay strong</h3><p>Don't get overwhelmed by what you can't do these days.
