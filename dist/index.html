Lockdown guidelines have forced us to stay indoors, and the events we’ve been training for have been cancelled or postponed. But instead of becoming lazy, we can make the most of this time by maintaining our fitness, working on problem areas, and engaging in virtual training and racing with the IRONMAN Virtual Club.</p><p>But before you hop on your trainer for 4 hours, know that virtual races and intense or long indoor training sessions need a nutrition plan, just like in the real world. Here’s what you need to know when you move your training, racing, and nutrition indoors.</p><h3 id="hydration">Hydration</h3><p>There is no natural air cooling in indoor training, which means the body can\'t dissipate the heat it produces during exercise quite as well as it does outdoors. In short, this means you sweat a lot more. A powerful fan can undoubtedly help, but hydration is vital whenever you’re sweating. Here are some guidelines per your training duration:</p><p><strong><strong>40 minutes or less:</strong></strong> Just water is enough, but take a potassium-magnesium sachet afterwards.</p><p><strong><strong>1 hour +: </strong></strong>Use a sports drink mixture containing carbohydrates and electrolytes in your bottle, or take one Enervit Salt Caps dissolved in water every hour.</p><h3 id="supplements">Supplements</h3><p>Carbohydrates are essential for the triathlete in training. They can stimulate your training, reduce muscle fatigue, and speed up recovery times between sessions. Not taking in enough carbohydrates in sessions longer than an hour would be a lost opportunity and also render your training less effective. Here are some guidelines per training duration:</p><p><strong><strong>1-2 hours:</strong></strong> Take 30g of carbohydrates per hour from a gel or Enervit One Hand.</p><p><strong><strong>2+ hours:</strong></strong> Take 60g of carbohydrates per hour from a gel, sports drink, or energy bars.</p><h3 id="recuperate">Recuperate</h3><p>Remember: recovery trains. The nutrients you consume in the first half-hour after your session can reduce fatigue and speed up recovery between sessions. You will need water, minerals, carbohydrates and essential amino acids. Recovery drinks are ideal: in one gulp you can get everything your body is craving.</p><p>To get the maximum benefit from your indoor sessions, you should eat a meal containing protein afterwards: fish, chicken, turkey, eggs, and tofu are all good options. These foods will help activate the proper muscle processes. (If you’re having trouble finding these foods then a good alternative is to add protein powder to your recovery drink.)</p><h3 id="stay-positive-stay-strong">Stay positive, stay strong</h3><p>Don\'t get overwhelmed by what you can\'t do these days. Instead, focus on the positive and take this opportunity to focus on strength, technique, and cultivating a positive outlook.</p><p> </p>',comment_id:f,feature_image:"https://edgardomedina.ghost.io/content/images/2020/10/enervit_thumb.jpg",featured:_,visibility:o,send_email_when_published:i,created_at:a,updated_at:"2020-10-21T21:47:58.000+00:00",published_at:"2020-10-18T22:25:35.000+00:00",custom_excerpt:w,codeinjection_head:e,codeinjection_foot:e,custom_template:e,canonical_url:e,authors:[{id:s,name:r,slug:t,profile_image:n,cover_image:e,bio:c,website:d,location:h,facebook:t,twitter:t,meta_title:e,meta_description:e,url:l}],tags:[],primary_author:{id:s,name:r,slug:t,profile_image:n,cover_image:e,bio:c,website:d,location:h,facebook:t,twitter:t,meta_title:e,meta_description:e,url:l},primary_tag:e,url:"https://edgardomedina.ghost.io/welcome/",excerpt:w,reading_time:2,access:_,og_image:e,og_title:e,og_description:e,twitter_image:e,twitter_title:e,twitter_description:e,meta_title:e,meta_description:e,email_subject:e},{id:y,uuid:"d51f8883-6a47-4203-9109-c4f34a8794cd",title:"Mastering Breath in the Swim",slug:"the-editor",html:'<figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://edgardomedina.ghost.io/content/images/2020/10/25_rookielessons_swim_hanssplinter-1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt srcset="https://edgardomedina.ghost.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/10/25_rookielessons_swim_hanssplinter-1.jpg 600w, https://edgardomedina.ghost.io/content/images/2020/10/25_rookielessons_swim_hanssplinter-1.jpg 740w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Of the three disciplines of triathlon, the swim usually comes with the highest intimidation factor for newcomers. Many of us spend our childhoods biking and running, with water activities reserved for boating, lounging around or cooling off. Mastering the mechanics of stroke, body position, sighting, breathing and drafting is a lifelong pursuit—something every triathlete must work diligently at in their training.</p><p>We asked our Facebook community what your biggest obstacles are when it came to swimming, gathered the responses, and enlisted reigning IRONMAN world champion Pete Jacobs for expert advice.</p><p>Your biggest concern: When, how and whether or not to breathe on both sides.</p><p><strong><strong>Pete Jacobs on Breathing Right:</strong></strong></p><p>Breathing on both sides, also called "bilateral breathing," allows you to change your breathing side throughout a race to accommodate for wind chop. It also means that, in training, you can breathe every three strokes, which will allow you to focus more on your stroke.</p><p>Working on a more even stroke on both sides is also important. Being relaxed is very important in swimming, and timing your breath makes this a lot easier. Practice swimming catch-up drills, where you leave one arm out in front until the other hand hits the water. But don\'t become a snail: keep your arms moving at a normal pace, just pause in front longer. This will help you work on your rhythm.</p><p>Another thing to keep in mind, when it comes to breathing, is to be sure not to breathe too early. Tilt your head to the side as your shoulders roll, then breathe under your armpit as your arm is coming over in recovery. Then, as your hand hits the water and your shoulders roll back, take your head with you. Breathing is easier if you look back at a 45 degree angle under your arm and make sure that the crown of your head points forward, not up. The aim is to get your mouth out of the water, not your eyes.</p><p>Good luck!</p>',comment_id:y,feature_image:"https://edgardomedina.ghost.io/content/images/2020/10/25_rookielessons_swim_hanssplinter.jpg",featured:i,visibility:o,send_email_when_published:i,created_at:a,updated_at:"2020-10-21T21:46:41.000+00:00",published_at:"2020-10-18T22:25:34.000+00:00",custom_excerpt:b,codeinjection_head:e,codeinjection_foot:e,custom_template:e,canonical_url:e,authors:[{id:"1",name:v,slug:k,profile_image:e,cover_image:e,bio:e,website:e,location:e,facebook:e,twitter:e,meta_title:e,meta_description:e,url:x}],tags:[{id:g,name:u,slug:m,description:e,feature_image:e,visibility:o,og_image:e,og_title:e,og_description:e,twitter_image:e,twitter_title:e,twitter_description:e,meta_title:e,meta_description:e,codeinjection_head:e,codeinjection_foot:e,canonical_url:e,accent_color:e,url:p}],primary_author:{id:"1",name:v,slug:k,profile_image:e,cover_image:e,bio:e,website:e,location:e,facebook:e,twitter:e,meta_title:e,meta_description:e,url:x},primary_tag:{id:g,name:u,slug:m,description:e,feature_image:e,visibility:o,og_image:e,og_title:e,og_description:e,twitter_image:e,twitter_title:e,twitter_description:e,meta_title:e,meta_description:e,codeinjection_head:e,codeinjection_foot:e,canonical_url:e,accent_color:e,url:p},url:"https://edgardomedina.ghost.io/the-editor/",excerpt:b,reading_time:2,access:_,og_image:e,og_title:e,og_description:e,twitter_image:e,twitter_title:e,twitter_description:e,meta_title:e,meta_description:e,email_subject:e},{id:j,uuid:"360bf543-66b8-42a0-a896-067ec35ed629",title:"Managing admin settings",slug:"admin-settings",html:'<h2 id="make-your-site-private">Make your site private</h2><p>If you\'ve got a publication that you don\'t want the world to see yet because it\'s not ready to launch, you can hide your Ghost site behind a basic shared pass-phrase.</p><p>You can toggle this preference on at the bottom of Ghost\'s General Settings:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://static.ghost.org/v1.0.0/images/private.png" class="kg-image" alt></figure><p>Ghost will give you a short, randomly generated pass-phrase which you can share with anyone who needs access to the site while you\'re working on it. While this setting is enabled, all search engine optimisation features will be switched off to help keep your site under the radar.</p><p>Do remember though, this is <em>not</em> secure authentication. You shouldn\'t rely on this feature for protecting important private data. It\'s just a simple, shared pass-phrase for some very basic privacy.</p><h2 id="invite-your-team">Invite your team </h2><p>Ghost has a number of different user roles for your team:</p><p><strong>Contributors</strong><br>This is the base user level in Ghost. Contributors can create and edit their own draft posts, but they are unable to edit drafts of others or publish posts. Contributors are <strong>untrusted</strong> users with the most basic access to your publication.</p><p><strong>Authors</strong><br>Authors are the 2nd user level in Ghost. Authors can write, edit  and publish their own posts. Authors are <strong>trusted</strong> users. If you don\'t trust users to be allowed to publish their own posts, they should be set as Contributors.</p><p><strong>Editors</strong><br>Editors are the 3rd user level in Ghost. Editors can do everything that an Author can do, but they can also edit and publish the posts of others - as well as their own. Editors can also invite new Contributors &amp; Authors to the site.</p><p><strong>Administrators</strong><br>The top user level in Ghost is Administrator. Again, administrators can do everything that Authors and Editors can do, but they can also edit all site settings and data, not just content. Additionally, administrators have full access to invite, manage or remove any other user of the site.<br><br><strong>The Owner</strong><br>There is only ever one owner of a Ghost site. The owner is a special user which has all the same permissions as an Administrator, but with two exceptions: The Owner can never be deleted. And in some circumstances the owner will have access to additional special settings if applicable. For example: billing details, if using <a href="https://ghost.org/pricing/"><strong>Ghost(Pro)</strong></a>.</p><blockquote><em>It\'s a good idea to ask all of your users to fill out their user profiles, including bio and social links.

By tagging posts with one or more keyword, you can organise articles into buckets of related content.</p><p>When you create content for your publication you can assign tags to help differentiate between categories of content. </p><p>For example you may tag some content with News and other content with Podcast, which would create two distinct categories of content listed on <code>/tag/news/</code> and <code>/tag/podcast/</code>, respectively.</p><p>If you tag a post with both <code>News</code> <em>and</em> <code>Podcast</code> - then it appears in both sections. Tag archives are like dedicated home-pages for each category of content that you have. They have their own pages, their own RSS feeds, and can support their own cover images and meta data.</p><h3 id="the-primary-tag">The primary tag</h3><p>Inside the Ghost editor, you can drag and drop tags into a specific order. The first tag in the list is always given the most importance, and some themes will only display the primary tag (the first tag in the list) by default. </p><blockquote><em><strong>News</strong>, Technology, Startup</em></blockquote><p>So you can add the most important tag which you want to show up in your theme, but also add related tags which are less important.</p><h3 id="private-tags">Private tags</h3><p>Sometimes you may want to assign a post a specific tag, but you don\'t necessarily want that tag appearing in the theme or creating an archive page. In Ghost, hashtags are private and can be used for special styling.</p><p>For example, if you sometimes publish posts with video content - you might want your theme to adapt and get rid of the sidebar for these posts, to give more space for an embedded video to fill the screen. In this case, you could use private tags to tell your theme what to do.</p><blockquote><em><strong>News</strong>, #video</em></blockquote><p>Here, the theme would assign the post publicly displayed tags of News - but it would also keep a private record of the post being tagged with #video. In your theme, you could then look for private tags conditionally and give them special formatting. </p><blockquote><em>You can find documentation for theme development techniques like this and many more over on Ghost\'s extensive <a href="https://ghost.org/docs/api/handlebars-themes/">theme docs</a>.</em></blockquote><h2 id="dynamic-routing">Dynamic routing</h2><p>Dynamic routing gives you the ultimate freedom to build a custom publication to suit your needs. Routes are rules that map URL patterns to your content and templates. </p><p>You may not want content tagged with <code>News</code> to exist on: <code>example.com/tag/news</code>. Instead, you want it to exist on <code>example.com/news</code> .</p><p>In this case you can use dynamic routes to create customised collections of content on your site. It\'s also possible to use multiple templates in your theme to render each content type differently.</p><p>There are lots of use cases for dynamic routing with Ghost, here are a few common examples: </p><ul><li>Setting a custom home page with its own template</li><li>Having separate content hubs for blog and podcast, that render differently, and have custom RSS feeds to support two types of content</li><li>Creating a founders column as a unique view, by filtering content created by specific authors</li><li>Including dates in permalinks for your posts</li><li>Setting posts to have a URL relative to their primary tag like <code>example.com/europe/story-title/</code><br></li></ul><blockquote><em>Dynamic routing can be configured in Ghost using <a href="http://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">YAML</a> files.
